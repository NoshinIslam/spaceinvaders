# spaceinvaders
In this project we will create a retro style Space Invaders Game where players control a spaceship to shoot down invading alien spaceships while avoiding their attack.
The letter 'A' represents the spaceship and the letters 'V' represent the aliens.
There will be no more than four aliens at once on the screen.
Our spaceship will be able to move left and right, back and forth by using 'A','D','W' and 'S' key respectively.
Our spaceship will be able to use bullets using the 'Enter' key.
Once the bullet hits an alien, user gets one point.
And if the alien gets the user first; i.e, catches up to the spaceship, he/she loses.
Enjoy!
