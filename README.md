# spaceinvaders
In this project we will create a retro style Space Invaders Game where players control a spaceship to shoot down invading alien spaceships while avoiding their attack.
There will be no more than four alien at once on the screen.
Our spaceship will be able to move left and right,back and forth by using 'A','D','N' and 'W' respectively.
Our spaceship will be able to to use bullets using 'O' in the keyboard.
As this is a text based game, user needs to press the 'Enter' button continuously to see motion.
Once the bullet hits an alien, you get one point.
And if the alien gets you first, you loose.
Enjoy!
